#  TestCloudKit Project

Attempting to test a CloudKit many to one relationship. **Works! However does not show up in the CloudKit Dashboard UI but it is there.**

Tried resetting the container in between changes with the data model and seemed to make no difference. Can see a String attribute in CloudKit dashboard for the CD_User record type in a field called CD_account, however not the reverse for the CD Account record.
